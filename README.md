# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms
Personal study & memo for C#, the base lecture by Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms by ZTM.

## Data Structures

## Algorithms
Collective functions & datas simply call the **algorithm** to perform desired action with steps & process for a computers.

- **Data Structures + Algorithms = Programs**
- **Class()         + Function{} = Programs**

## Contents
- Big-O
- Data Structures
  - Arrays
  - Hash Tables *
  - Linked Lists
  - Stack + Queues **
  - Trees *
  - Graph *
- Algorithms
  - Recursion **
  - Sorting **
###### * Popularity at Interview

### Force Memory Clean in C#
Especially C#, sometimes needs manually clean the null variable to destroy with **GC**(Garbage Collection) force call.

    Class class = new Class();
    ...
    class = null; // Assign null that the GC recognize
    GC.Collect(); // Force dispose
